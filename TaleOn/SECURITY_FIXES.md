# ðŸ”’ TaleOn Security Fixes & Improvements

This document outlines all the critical security issues that have been identified and fixed in the TaleOn project.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Issues (FIXED)

### 1. âœ… Socket Authentication Missing
**Issue**: Users could join rooms via socket with just `{ roomCode, username }`, no real authentication.

**Risk**: Anyone could spoof usernames or join rooms without permission.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added JWT token validation to socket handshake
- Added room membership verification before allowing socket connections
- Updated frontend to send authentication token with socket connections
- Added error handling for authentication failures

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/sockets/gameSocket.js`
- `taleon/src/utils/socket.js`
- `taleon/src/pages/room/Lobby.jsx`

### 2. âœ… Forgot/Reset Password Flow Missing
**Issue**: Only login/signup implemented, forgot password was just a placeholder.

**Risk**: Locked-out users = permanently lost accounts.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Complete email-based password reset flow
- Added reset token generation and validation
- Added email sending functionality with nodemailer
- Updated frontend components to handle password reset
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/models/User.js` (added reset token fields)
- `taleon-backend/src/controllers/authController.js` (added forgot/reset functions)
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js` (added new routes)
- `taleon/src/pages/auth/ForgotPassword.jsx`
- `taleon/src/pages/auth/ResetPassword.jsx`
- `taleon/src/App.jsx` (updated route)

### 3. âœ… Host-Only Permissions Not Enforced Server-Side
**Issue**: Backend `/game/start` didn't strictly enforce host-only permissions.

**Risk**: Any player could call "start" directly via API.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added strict host verification: `req.user._id === room.host`
- Added security logging for unauthorized attempts
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/gameRoutes.js`

## ðŸŸ  Important Issues (FIXED)

### 4. âœ… Inconsistent /game/start Starter Logic
**Issue**: Frontend assumed `players[0]` is toss winner, backend didn't explicitly send starter info.

**Risk**: If backend changed player order, frontend would break.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Backend now explicitly returns `{ starterUserId, starterName }`
- Frontend uses explicit starter information from backend
- Added fallback to maintain backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/gameRoutes.js`
- `taleon/src/pages/room/Toss.jsx`

### 5. âœ… AI User Handling (System Account)
**Issue**: AI user created with fixed password, no system flag.

**Risk**: AI account could be abused if auth enabled.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added `system: true` flag to User model
- Block system accounts from logging in
- Auto-create AI user with random password and system flag
- Enhanced security logging

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/models/User.js`
- `taleon-backend/src/controllers/authController.js`
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/gameRoutes.js`

### 6. âœ… Legacy API Routes Removed
**Issue**: `/game/:id/turn` still existed alongside new flow.

**Risk**: Users might bypass new logic and cause state inconsistencies.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Removed legacy `/game/:id/turn` route
- Added comment indicating route removal
- All clients now use the new `/game/turn` endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/gameRoutes.js`

### 7. âœ… Error Handling / Feedback Improved
**Issue**: Used `alert()` for errors throughout the app.

**Risk**: Bad UX, not professional.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive toast notification system
- Replaced all `alert()` calls with proper toast notifications
- Added loading states and better user feedback
- Implemented different toast types (success, error, warning, info)

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon/src/components/UI/Toast.jsx` (new file)
- `taleon/src/App.jsx` (added ToastProvider)
- `taleon/src/pages/auth/Login.jsx`
- `taleon/src/pages/room/Toss.jsx`
- `taleon/src/pages/room/Lobby.jsx`
- `taleon/src/pages/game/GameRoom.jsx`

### 8. âœ… Archive Flow Enhanced
**Issue**: Had `/game/my` and archive UI, but no clean endpoint for public archives.

**Risk**: Archive page felt incomplete.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive archive endpoint with filters
- Added pagination support
- Added verdict and genre filtering
- Added metadata for better UX

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon-backend/src/routes/gameRoutes.js`

### 9. âœ… Session Storage Fragility Addressed
**Issue**: Tokens, roomCode, gameId lived in sessionStorage.

**Risk**: Users lose state on refresh.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Created rejoin logic utility
- Added session restoration on page load
- Added rejoin modal for active sessions
- Enhanced error handling for session recovery

**Files Modified**:
- `taleon/src/utils/rejoin.js` (new file)
- `taleon/src/pages/home/Landing.jsx`

## ðŸ”§ Environment Configuration

### Email Setup for Password Reset
Added email configuration to environment files:

**Development** (`env.development.example`):
```
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
FROM_NAME=TaleOn Dev
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Production** (`env.production.example`):
```
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
FROM_NAME=TaleOn
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you need to use an App Password, not your regular password.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Added

### Backend
- `nodemailer` - For email sending
- `crypto` - For password reset token generation (built-in)

### Frontend
- No new dependencies (used existing React context)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

1. **Socket Authentication**: Test joining rooms with invalid/expired tokens
2. **Password Reset**: Test complete flow from forgot password to reset
3. **Host Permissions**: Test game start with non-host users
4. **AI System Account**: Verify AI user cannot log in
5. **Toast Notifications**: Test all error scenarios
6. **Session Recovery**: Test page refresh during active games
7. **Archive Filters**: Test pagination and filtering

## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes

1. Set up email credentials in environment variables
2. Ensure JWT_SECRET is properly configured
3. Update FRONTEND_URL for production
4. Test all authentication flows
5. Monitor socket connections for authentication errors

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Considerations

- Consider implementing rate limiting for password reset requests
- Add email templates for better UX
- Consider implementing session timeout
- Add audit logging for security events
- Consider implementing 2FA for enhanced security

---

**Status**: All critical security issues have been addressed and the application is now production-ready with proper security measures in place.
